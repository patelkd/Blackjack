1. The one thing that does not function correctly within my program is the double down function. The double down button in the appletviewer doubles the bet, but does not automatically add another card to the player's hand.

2. The single best feature of the program is the display. The display makes it easy to understand the player's score, the dealer's score, the player's bet, and the result of the game.

3. Classes in java provide places for the specific action's to take place. The different classes all function together to make the code work properly. The classes create a complicated program as there are many small details that can be added into the code in different classes. The classes also make the code easier to understand, instead of just using one class.

4. A public variable is accessible everywhere in the code, while a private variable is only accessible within the class itself. A private method can only be called within the class it is located in. A public method can be accessed by the class where it is defined, or from other classes of the program.

5. Class variable memory allocate at the time of compilation. Instance variables are declared in the class and are the objects created at the runtime.

6. Inheritance is the process where one object acquires the properties of another. Inheritance can take place through classes.

7. The use of 'this' when coding is to reference the a current object. It is useful when there are various objects in a class. 'Super' is used to call the same method that is defined in the parent class.

8. Objects have to properties: 1) Behavior and 2) State

9. Something that still confuses me is when a program has to extend something, implement something, or do neither.
